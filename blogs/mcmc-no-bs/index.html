            <article class="post-content">
                <p>Have been reading this <a href="https://www.jeremykun.com/2015/04/06/markov-chain-monte-carlo-without-all-the-bullshit/">article</a> for a while now and it&#39;s a great read, thus taking my own notes to understand it better.</p>
<h3>What is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)?</h3>
<ul>
<li>To put it simply, it&#39;s a technique to solve problem of random sampling from a complex distribution.</li>
<li>Imagine I got myself a cat(I love cats), now I want to give it a name, but there are a lot of possibilities like &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Lando&quot;, &quot;Max&quot;, &quot;Lewis&quot; etc. I have a friend who also likes cats and in one shady market he bought a magic box which upon custom settings for me, given a name will return the probabilty of that name being the name of my cat.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Cat naming probability visualization -->
<div class="visualization-container">
    <div class="visualization-title">Cat Naming Probability Distribution</div>
    <p>Hover over bars to see how the magic box returns probabilities for different cat names.</p>
    <div class="cat-name-container">
        <div class="sample-cat" id="sampleCat">🐱</div>
        <div class="probability-bars" id="probBars">
            <!-- Bars will be added by JavaScript -->
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="controls-container">
        <button class="control-btn" id="sampleBtn">Generate Sample</button>
        <button class="control-btn" id="resetBtn">Reset</button>
    </div>
</div>

<ul>
<li>That custom settings is called the distribution specific to my preferences. (Consider that it can&#39;t be tempered)</li>
<li>Since the names are Distinct, D is a Discrete probability distribution and for discrete distributions, we can define a probability mass function (PMF) which is a function that gives the probability of a discrete random variable taking a certain value (in our case, the cat name)</li>
<li>In reality, these distributions are skewed, where popular names like (lewis, Max) have higher probability than others.</li>
<li>Now any person would think it is a good idea, keep giving it names and it will give me sort of compatibility of that name that I look for my cats, so after say a few tries, it gives a high probability to the name &quot;Carlos&quot;, and since it was customized to me, I&#39;m fairly happy with it.</li>
<li>You might wonder, what is the problem? and where does MCMC come into picture?</li>
<li>The problem is I want to draw names from that distribution, but effeciently! Why the current process not efficient? you ask. Well, I don&#39;t know what method that magic box uses to give me the probability, can I simulate it? No, I might even get biased towards it, just because I&#39;ve been told that it will help you decide a good name, so I might start thinking that &quot;Carlos&quot; is a good name, even it might not be, maybe &quot;Kimi&quot; was the perfect name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sampling directly from D is hard because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t know the internal process that defines 𝐷 (i.e., how you pick names).</li>
<li>𝐷 is complicated, with potentially many names and uneven probabilities.</li>
<li>Direct sampling (e.g., listing all names and their probabilities) is impractical due to the large number of possible names.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let&#39;s add one more layer to this to avoid that forced bias, once we get the probability of that name, we&#39;ll also carry a biased coin, which we&#39;ll flip to decide whether to accept that name or not.</p>
<h4>Uniform Sampling with a Biased Coin</h4>
<ul>
<li>Generate a name 𝑥 uniformly at random: Pick a name from the set of all possible names, where each name has an equal chance of being chosen. For example, if there are 10,000 names, each has a 1/10000 chance of being picked.</li>
<li>Query the magic box for 𝑃(𝑥): Ask the box for the probability 𝑃(𝑥) that you would choose name 𝑥 according to 𝐷.</li>
<li>Flip a biased coin with probability 
𝑃(𝑥): Use a coin where the probability of landing on heads is 
𝑃(𝑥) If the coin lands heads, accept 𝑥 as your sample. If it lands tails, reject 𝑥 and start over (generate a new name and repeat).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why This Setup?</strong>: This is a form of rejection sampling. The coin flip ensures that names with higher 𝑃(𝑥) are more likely to be accepted, so the accepted names follow the distribution 𝐷 However, it’s inefficient.</p>
<p>It&#39;s  inefficient because:
<strong>Exponentially many names</strong>: Exponentially many names: There are a vast number of possible names. The variable here is the number of bits needed to write down a name n=∣x∣ refers to the length of a name when encoded as a string (e.g., in a computer or as a sequence of characters).</p>
<p>Problematics Cases: </p>
<ol>
<li>Probabilities are exponentially small: If most names have very low probabilities (𝑃(𝑥) is tiny), the coin will rarely land heads, so you’ll reject most names and need many tries to get a sample.</li>
<li>Few names have nonzero probability: If only a few names have significant probabilities, you’ll rarely generate those names randomly, so you’ll need many tries to hit one.</li>
</ol>
<p>To understand it better, let&#39;s take an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose we have a distribution 𝐷 with 1M possible names, and the probability of each name is 1/1000000. </li>
<li>And say P(Alex) = 0.05, P(Max) = 0.02 which takes most of the probability mass, the rest of the names have very low probability. even less than 0.000001.</li>
<li>Now let&#39;s be optimistic and say luckily you got the name &quot;Max&quot;, the probability we have is 0.02, so only 2% of the time the coin will land heads and you&#39;ll accept it. so to get heads at least once, you&#39;ll need to try 50 times. You might say, 50 seems managable, right? But it&#39;s not that easy is it.</li>
<li>Only between us, Max comes every 10^6 times. So to reach those 50 tries, you&#39;ll need to endure this much sampling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let&#39;s get even more granular to the level of bits and computations.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 bit can save 2 values(0 or 1)</li>
<li>2 bits can save 4 values(00, 01, 10, 11)</li>
<li>n bits can save 2^n values</li>
</ul>
<p>Now when we talk about english characters, we have 26 characters, so we need 5 bits to represent each character. because 4 bits can only represent 16 values, and 5 bits can represent 32 values. so 5 bits will work for us.</p>
<p>and this also means that every character will be represented by 5 bits. such as </p>
<ul>
<li>a = 00000</li>
<li>b = 00001</li>
<li>c = 00010....</li>
</ul>
<p>now let&#39;s restric to the hypothesis that the name can be only one character long, like &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; etc. so we restrict the names list to 26 names. so for each name we&#39;ll have 5(1) bits. so for name with k characters, we&#39;ll have 5k bits.</p>
<ul>
<li>allowed 1 charracter names = 26 = 26^1</li>
<li>allowed 2 character names = 26 * 26 = 26^2</li>
<li>allowed 3 character names = 26 * 26 * 26 = 26^3</li>
<li>allowed k character names = 26 * 26 * 26 * 26 = 26^k</li>
</ul>
<p>so for allowed k characters long names, that earlier 1M now becomes 26^k. I don&#39;t even want to do that math for that.</p>
<h3>Random Walks, the &quot;Markov Chain&quot; Part of MCMC</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s go take some fun part—random walks and how they turn into Markov chains, which are the heart of MCMC. Imagine we’re exploring a map of places, and this map is what we call a directed graph. </p>

    </div>
</div>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>What’s a Directed Graph ( G = (V, E) )?</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Think of it as a map with spots (called <strong>vertices</strong> or <strong>nodes</strong>, written as ( V )) and one-way roads (called <strong>edges</strong>, written as ( E )) connecting them.  </li>
<li>In our example, the spots are emotional states: Cheerful (1), So-so (2), and Sad (3). The roads show how you can move from one state to another, like going from Cheerful to Sad.  </li>
<li>( G ) isn’t some magic property—it’s a tool we create to model how things (like emotions or names) change. We build it based on the problem we’re solving!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What’s a Random Walk?</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>It’s like a random stroll on this map. Start at one spot, say Cheerful (1), and decide where to go next using some chances.  </li>
<li>From Cheerful, you can:  <ul>
<li>Stay at Cheerful (1) with a 20% chance (0.2).  </li>
<li>Move to So-so (2) with a 30% chance (0.3).  </li>
<li>Move to Sad (3) with a 60% chance (0.6).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pick one randomly based on those chances, then repeat from the new spot. That’s your walk!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What Makes it a Markov Chain?</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>This random walk becomes a <strong>Markov chain</strong> when the next step only depends on where you are now, not where you’ve been before. Cool, right?  </li>
<li>For each road (edge) from spot ( u ) to spot ( v ), we give a probability ( p_{u,v} ) (between 0 and 1).  </li>
<li>Rule: The chances of all roads leaving a spot must add up to 1. For Cheerful (1): ( 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.6 = 1 ). This makes sure you always move somewhere!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How Does it Work in the Example?</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Start at Cheerful (1). Roll a “probability die” with weights 0.2, 0.3, 0.6. Say you get 0.6, so you move to Sad (3).  </li>
<li>From Sad (3), roll again with 0.0 (to Cheerful), 0.7 (to So-so), 0.3 (to Sad). Get 0.7, so move to So-so (2).  </li>
<li>Keep going—this is your Markov chain in action!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Why Care About This for MCMC?</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>For your cat names, we can use a similar map where spots are names, and roads connect “similar” names (e.g., “Max” to “Maxi”). The probabilities ( p_{u,v} ) help us jump around to find names matching your distribution ( D ).  </li>
<li>Over a long walk, you’ll spend more time at names you like, which is the goal of MCMC!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stationary Distribution (The Cool Part)</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>After lots of steps, the chance of being at any spot (like Cheerful) settles into a steady pattern, no matter where you started.  </li>
<li>This pattern is the <strong>stationary distribution</strong>—it’s like finding the “natural” mix of emotions or names you’d pick!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>One Catch</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>The walk only works if every spot has a way out (some maps have dead ends). We might need to tweak the map, but the idea of random walking is solid!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
