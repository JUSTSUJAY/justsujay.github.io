This is the second post of Quantum Computers Series, if you haven't already, please check out my first post on computers. Let's get started!

# Enter the Quantum Computer! âœ¨

Quantum computers don't use bits - they use something way cooler: **qubits**
Think of qubits as bits' wild cousins who play by different rules
The big difference? While a bit is stuck being **0 OR 1**, a qubit can be **0, 1, or BOTH at the same time!**
This mind-bending property is called **superposition**

# Superposition: Being Two Things at Once

Picture a spinning coin - is it heads or tails while spinning? Kind of both!
That's like a qubit - it can exist in multiple states until we measure it
**Example**: With 2 regular bits, we can represent one of 4 possible values at a time (00, 01, 10, or 11)
But with 2 qubits in superposition, we can represent all 4 values simultaneously!
It's like having multiple guesses at once instead of one at a time

# Entanglement: Spooky Teamwork

Quantum computers have another superpower: **entanglement**
Imagine two magic marbles - when one turns blue, the other instantly turns blue too, no matter the distance
That's entanglement: when qubits get linked so what happens to one instantly affects the other
Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance" because it seems so magical
This teamwork helps quantum computers solve certain puzzles much more efficiently
