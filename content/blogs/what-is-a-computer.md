This is the first post in the series of Quantum Computer, to understand what Quantum computers are, we first need to understand what's a computer, actually?

# What Even Is a Computer? ðŸ¤”
- **Think of a computer as a smart toy box** - you give it something (input), it thinks about it, then gives you something back (output)
- **Example**: Type "2+2" into a calculator â†’ it processes this â†’ outputs "4"
- That's computing in its simplest form! **Input â†’ Process â†’ Output**

# The Computers We Use Daily
- Classical computers are what we use every day - **phones, laptops, gaming consoles**
- They're amazing at everyday tasks - **playing videos, opening documents, sending messages**
- But... they sometimes hit a wall with super complex problems
- That's where **quantum computers** come in - like superheroes for certain types of problems!

# Peek Inside: The Bit Brigade
- Classical computers use **bits** - tiny "helpers" that work like light switches
- A bit can only be **OFF (0)** or **ON (1)** - just two possible states
- These bits team up to represent everything: **numbers, letters, pictures, videos**
- **Example**: The letter "A" in computer language is "01000001" - a string of 8 bits

# The Bit Limitation
- Bits can only be one thing at a time - either **0 OR 1**
- For complex problems with many possibilities, classical computers **try each option one by one**
- Like searching a giant maze by **checking each path individually**
- Fine for simple tasks, but can **take forever for really complex problems**
